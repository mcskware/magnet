Minecraft 1.13 vanilla magnet

Here's a simple magnet for vanilla Minecraft 1.13. When the player holds an item with the NBT data {magnet:1b}, it will pull the closest item toward the player. When the player picks up that item, it will then move to the next item. It has a range of 6 meters, but that's configurable in tick.mcfunction.

I'm really hoping to figure out a way to apply this magnetization to all items within range at once, but so far that knowledge is escaping me :)

Comments and critiques always welcome!

Cheers
